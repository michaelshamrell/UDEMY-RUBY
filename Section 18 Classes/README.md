Intro to Classes
classes are blueprints for creating objects
why do we need classes: 
ruby's built in bjects like arrays or hashes cannot represent everythign
what if we need to represent users or cars or invoices?
the goal of onject oriented design is to use code to model real-life things as classes
an object is a custom container for data. It is made from a class
objects group functionalities into a single unit.

Object Attributes and Methods
- isntance variables: are variables that belong to the object
- Attributes: provide information about the object's current state
- Instance methods: interact with the object. THey also belong to the object.
- Encapsultion: is a OOP concept hat restricts direct access to an object.

Classes and Objects:
- a class is the blueprint, pattern, template, or outline for an object.
- an object is an isntance of the class. It is created from the class
- isntantiation is the process of creating an object from a class
- a class is called an abstract type becuase it hides the complexity of interacting with te data, much like a method abstracts the complexity of a process
