#You can use comments to debug, add notes, explanations and stylistic formatting
#Comments in ruby start with the hash symbol (#)
#comments are ignored by the ruby interpreter 



#this prints out "hello world" to the terminal
puts "hello world"

#you can also put comments after lines of code

puts "hello world" #Everything before this is still valid code

#the standard way that comments are formatted include a 
#hashtag on every line

=begin

anythign that goes in between these two lines are 
commented code

puts "hello world"
p 5 + 5

this is not a very popular of common method
=end

#you can highlight code and do ctrl + / to comment out big chunks of 
#code, and vice versa
